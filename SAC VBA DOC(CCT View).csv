Account Selection - CCT,btnProceed,Go To Account,Command Button,,,,,,,,,"The Proceed button decides where the user should go next based on whether the work is:

Non?Affinity business, or
Affinity business

It also prevents users from proceeding unless they have made the required selection first.

Step 1: Check the business type (optAffinAcct)
The logic starts by checking the value of optAffinAcct:

optAffinAcct = 2 ? This means NOT Affinity Business
Any other value ? This means Affinity Business

This option determines which workflow and form will be opened next.

Step 2: Non?Affinity Business path (optAffinAcct = 2)
Validation check
Before moving forward, the code checks whether the user selected any account information by verifying these controls:

cboAcctName
cboCustNum
cboPolicy
cboAffiliate
cboProducer
cboNamedInsured

If all of these are Null, then:

A message box appears saying:
“You have made an account selection yet. Please go back and select an account.”
Message type: Information
Title: Selection Required
The procedure stops immediately (Exit Sub)

Successful validation
If at least one of those fields has a value:

The form frmAccountParent_CCT is opened
This moves the user into the non?affinity account workflow


Step 3: Affinity Business path (Else branch)
Validation check
For affinity business, the required selections are program?based, so the code checks:

cboAffinName
cboAffinCode

If both are Null:

A message box appears saying:
“You have made an program selection yet. Please go back and select a program.”
Message type: Information
Title: Selection Required
The procedure stops immediately

Successful validation
If either field has a value:

The form frmAffinityParent_CCT is opened
This moves the user into the affinity program workflow


Final outcome in simple terms

The button routes the user to the correct next screen based on business type.
It enforces required selections so users can’t proceed without choosing:

An Account (for non?affinity), or
A Program (for affinity).


It prevents blank or accidental workflow progression.",36,,,,
