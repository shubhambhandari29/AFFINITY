If data is migrated from on Prem SQL Server to Azure SQL, test: 

Schema validation 

Tables, columns, data types, constraints, indexes 

Row count reconciliation 

Per table counts, per partition/date range 

Data correctness sampling 

Record-level comparisons for critical entities 

Data integrity 

Foreign keys, orphan records, duplicate keys 

Business rule reconciliation 

Aggregates, reports totals, computed fields 

Cutover readiness 

Delta migration strategy, rollback plan, validation scripts 

As part of the migration from the on‑premises SQL Server database to the Azure SQL Managed Instance, we carried out comprehensive data migration testing to ensure that all schema objects and data were transferred accurately and completely.
