Is there any way to auto-open it?
There is only one Enterprise-grade way to achieve "Auto-Open + Rich HTML" without a download, but it requires backend work:
The Microsoft Graph API Solution:If your company uses Office 365, you can have your Backend (API) talk to Microsoft directly.
Frontend sends UserID to Backend.
Backend calls Microsoft Graph API (POST /me/messages) to create a Draft in the user's "Drafts" folder.
Backend returns a "Deep Link" URL to that specific message ID.
Frontend opens that URL in a popup.
If you are strictly limited to "Frontend Only" without new backend API integrations, the Download method (Option 1) is the standard industry workaround for this limitation.
