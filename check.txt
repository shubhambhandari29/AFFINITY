Summary​

I'm a Python Backend Developer with experience across insurance, banking, healthcare and pharma domains. Skilled in Python, FastAPI, Flask, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes (Openshift), MS Azure and Airflow. Currently at EXL, I work on backend engineering for internal insurance platform, building secure FastAPI services, SQL-backed workflows, authentication system & APIs that support account, policy, search and reporting use cases. My work focuses on building reliable, maintainable backend systems with strong validation, testing and deployment practices.  I look forward to work on projects that combine backend engineering, automation, and applied AI to deliver measurable business impact.​

Key Projects​

Python FastAPI developer | Developed internal platform for insurance client with robust APIs​

Overview : Worked on backend engineering for internal insurance operation platform, building secure FastAPI services and SQL server-backed workflows that support account, policy, search and reporting operations.​

Activities:  Built and maintained FastAPI route modules covering various workflows such as account management, policy handling, loss run, deduct billing, program search and user administration.​

Design and architecture : Designed reusable SQL server data-access helpers with parameterized queries, filter sanitization, async wrappers and merge based upsert/delete patterns to standardize CRUD operations and reduce duplicate service logic.​

Authentication – Implemented secure authentication using JWT access/refresh tokens, HTTP-only cookies, password hashing/rehashing and protected internal APIs for enterprise users.​

Testing -  Strenghtened engineering quality by expanding automated coverage across core, service and API layers with tests for auth, validation and business critical workflows. Also created Locust-based load tests for a user journey and supported azure DevOps deployment to linux wev app environments.  ​

Logging and Utilities – Added platform capabilities such as structured logging, pydantic validation, dropdown management and outlook compose intergration to improve reliability and user productivity.​

Tech stack – Python, FastAPI, Rest APIs, git, SQL, MS Azure, pydantic, PyODBC, JWT, Locust​

​

Python FastAPIdeveloper | Designed and created Python based banking microservices using event-driven protocols such as Kafka​

Overview:  Contributed to Agentic AI platform that automates trade confirmation document review with a 93% automation rate, reducing manual risk and freeing up ~20000 annual hours, supporting over 14 additonal use cases helping unlock an estimated 70000-80000 hours of future productivity capacity and driving operation excellence.​

Activities : Designed and built scalable backend systems in Python/FastAPI for a leading backend client. Develoiping a Kafka-based intergration platform for seamless event-driven messaging and API connectivity.​

Database & deployments: Manage PostGreSQL databases and ensure efficient deployments using docker and CI/CD pipelines, with utizing RedHat OpenShift for container orchestration, enhancing system reliability and performance.​

Testing –Wrote and maintained unit test cases to improve code quality and ensure robust production deployments,​

Tech stack – python, FastAPI, Kafka, jira, git, pytest, docker, redhat openshift, postgreSQL​

​

Python Flask developer | Flask project for a leading banking client to extract data from PDF, excel word and load on UI with apache airflow​

Overview: Developed and maintained Flask backend APIs for a platform that ingested and processed documents to extract required fields and display them on UI by using apache  airflow workflows to schedule ingestion and extraction for documents.​

Activities : Designed and built scalable backend systems in Python/FastAPI for a leading backend client. Develoiping a Kafka-based intergration platform for seamless event-driven messaging and API connectivity.​

Business geography:  Built and optimized APIs to support multiple tenants, each requiring custom workflows for different document formats and geographies.​

Event driven architecture–Utilized Solace messaging service for inter-application communication and ensured smooth integration.​

Tech stack – python, Flask, Solace, jira, git, pytest, docker, redhat openshift, MongoDB​
