2.10 Security Testing
You typically do:
Authentication (SSO/OAuth if used)
Authorization (RBAC, row-level access)
Input validation (SQL injection, XSS)
Secrets management (no keys in code/config)
Audit logging (who did what, when)
Also recommended:
Dependency scanning (React and Python libs)
API security testing (OWASP API Top 10 patterns)



2.4 Integration Testing (Service ↔ Azure SQL)
Goal: Validate correctness of real integration between FastAPI and Azure SQL.
Includes:
SQL queries correctness
Transaction integrity (commit/rollback)
Stored procedures/functions (if any)
Connection pooling, timeouts
Azure-specific behavior (e.g., collation differences, compatibility level, performance)
